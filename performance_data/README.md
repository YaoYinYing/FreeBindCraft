# Performance Data

This directory contains benchmark artifacts and example outputs comparing FreeBindCraft (PyRosetta bypass; `--no-pyrosetta`) with traditional BindCraft using PyRosetta. Datasets are organized by target/system and include:

- Accepted-design statistics CSVs generated by each pipeline variant
- Zipped run artifacts (accepted PDBs, logs, and per-run CSVs)
- Rescoring results in which FreeBindCraft outputs are evaluated with PyRosetta metrics

Available dataset(s):

- `pdl1_miniprotein/`: head-to-head comparison using the PDL1 example from the original BindCraft repository
